Each chapter takes you on a well-guided tour of the development and application of specific AI and big data techniques and brings you up to the minute on how they are being used by asset managers. Given the diverse backgrounds and affiliations of our authors, this book is the perfect companion to start, refine, or plan the next phase of your data science journey.
This book is the latest in a series of research initiatives from CFA Institute aimed at equipping practitioners and policymakers with the tools needed to evaluate and incorporate data science with the highest standards. Two precursors to this book will help set the stage for deeper appreciation. They are T-Shaped Teams: Organizing to Adopt AI and Big Data at Investment Firms and AI Pioneers in Investment Management. Weâ€™re also creating active learning opportunities, including our recently launched professional learning courses.
