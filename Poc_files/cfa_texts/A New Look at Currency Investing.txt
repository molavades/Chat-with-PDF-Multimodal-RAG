The authors of this book examine the rationale for investing in currency. They highlight
          several features of currency returns that make currency an attractive asset class for
          institutional investors. Using style factors to model currency returns provides a natural
          way to decompose returns into alpha and beta components. They find that several
          established currency trading strategies (variants of carry, trend-following, and value
          strategies) produce consistent returns that can be proxied as style or risk factors and
          have the nature of beta returns. Then, using two datasets of returns of actual currency
          hedge funds, they find that some currency managers produce true alpha. Finally, they find
          that adding to an institutional investor’s portfolio even a small amount of
          currency exposure—particularly to alpha generators—can make a meaningful
          positive impact on the portfolio’s performance.
