Featuring Thomas Idzorek and Paul Kaplan
For nearly three-quarters of a century, economists have strongly agreed that financial planning should be based on what are known as life-cycle models. At the heart of these life-cycle models is the relatively simple idea that to maximize lifetime utility, most people should save and invest some of their earnings during their working years to provide for their retirement, thus smoothing their inflation-adjusted consumption over their lifetimes. This idea goes back to Irving Fisher in 1930, and no less than eight Nobel Prizes (Samuelson 1970, Friedman 1976, Modigliani 1985, Becker 1992, Lucas 1995, Merton 1997, Fama 2013, and Deaton 2015) have gone to economists who did important work in life-cycle finance. Paradoxically, most financial planners and many investment textbooks are either unaware of or silent on life-cycle models and life-cycle finance.
This book proposes a practical, integrated three-stage model for financial planning that not only embraces life-cycle finance but also integrates it with single-period optimization models. We make three primary contributions to optimal financial planning.
Each of these three innovations represents a significant advancement in the implementation of life-cycle finance. Linking them into a cohesive three-stage model is a further advancement and is the most important aspect of our contribution to applied life-cycle finance.
