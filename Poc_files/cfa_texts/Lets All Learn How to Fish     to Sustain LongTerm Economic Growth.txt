Today’s economic growth challenges will become greater in the future because of the world’s aging population, fertility trends and current levels, and current entitlement policies. Those challenges could be overcome, however, with thoughtful public policies and a culture that fosters responsibility and appreciation. This book reconsiders what makes us “healthy, wealthy, and wise.” It focuses on how we might reimagine health care, retirement, and education policies to usher in a new ERA (from Entitlement to Responsibility with Appreciation) of sustainable long-term economic growth.
