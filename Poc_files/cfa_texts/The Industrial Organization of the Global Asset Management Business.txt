The dynamics of the asset management business are complex and geographically diverse.
Products and vendors compete within and across markets and often shade into each
other. Regulation can differ dramatically according to financial systems and
functions. Here are discussed the major asset management sectors—pension
funds, mutual funds, alternative investment vehicles, and private wealth management.
Despite the complexity of the industry, common threads run through the
discussion—growth, risk, and cost—that cannot be ignored by asset
managers hoping to be sustainably profitable. What is required to excel includes
distribution in leading markets, product breadth and consistency, global money
management expertise, and capital strength. Also needed are technological
capability, marketing and customer service skills, defensible pricing, low-cost
production, and a strong brand. All these characteristics must be rooted in an
affirmative culture with cohesive senior management and a talented and motivated
staff.
