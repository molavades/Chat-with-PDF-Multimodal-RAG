The ethical issues that financial professionals face are no different from the
                    ethical issues in any professionâ€”or, indeed, the day-to-day dilemmas we
                    all face. These issues are readily resolved through the use of three simple
                    questions: Does this violate the law? Is this honest? What if I were on the
                    other side? These three basic ethical standards are often complicated,
                    extrapolated, rationalized, refined, and confused as those in the financial
                    markets grapple with what they believe are more complex ethical issues today
                    than in the past. But as this review shows, the ethical issues in the financial
                    markets today are no different from those that managers of money and assets,
                    financial advisers, and analysts have faced over the centuries.
