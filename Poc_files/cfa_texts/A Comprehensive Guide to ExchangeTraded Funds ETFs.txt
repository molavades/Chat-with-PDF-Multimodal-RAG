Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have become in their 25-year history one of the fastest
growing segments of the investment management business. These funds provide liquid access to
virtually every financial market and allow large and small investors to build
institutional-caliber portfolios. Yet, their management fees are significantly lower than
those typical of mutual funds. High levels of transparency in ETFs for holdings and
investment strategy help investors evaluate an ETFâ€™s potential returns and risks.
This book covers the evolution of ETFs as products and in their uses in investment
strategies. It details how ETFs work, their unique investment and trading features, their
regulatory structure, how they are used in tactical and strategic portfolio management in a
broad range of asset classes, and how to evaluate them individually.
